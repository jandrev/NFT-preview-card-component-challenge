## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I mainly learned how to use CSS to style basic responsive designs. Especifically, I learned:
- CSS.
- Flexbox.
- The box-model.
- Pseudo-selectors.

### Continued development

Although I learned quite a lot about the box-model and Flexbox, I still feel I have a lot of progress to make on layouts. Besides that, I should research on best practices regarding when I should or should not use ids and classes. My main focus right now is to get skillful at using HTML and CSS.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - The CSS documentation here is incredibly thourough and well-written. I found an answer to almost all my questions in these docs.
